            We are a group off people interested in making a positive and lasting difference to the environment. During
            the last decades, the world population has grown exponentially, consequently, the demand for the products we
            consume on a daily basis produces unbelievable levels of waste that most of the time end up in the seas and
            oceans, thus threatening the life of the species that live there, destroying their ecosystems and even
            putting them at risk of extinction.
            Our aim is to reduce the impact of debris on these marine ecosystems.</p>
